Song pointer table
===================
There are two minor variations of the driver, which differ slightly between the song pointer table. For the earlier version (used in e.g. Wario Land 2), look for the following series of commands:

ld l, c
ld h, b
add hl, hl
add hl, bc
add hl, hl
ld bc, SongTable

Which equals the following in hex:
69 60 29 09 29 01 ?? ??

For the later version (used in e.g. Wario Land 3), look for the following series of commands:

ld l, c
ld h, b
add hl, hl
add hl, hl
add hl, hl
ld bc, SongTable

Which equals the following in hex:
69 60 29 29 29 01 ?? ??

In the earlier version of the driver, the song list is structured as follows:
1-2 = pointer
3 = bank
4 = stereo/pan mask? (all music uses value of 64?)
5 = ?
6 = number of channels

In the later version of the driver:
1-2 = pointer
3-4 = bank
5-6 = stereo/pan mask? (all music uses value of 64?)
7-8 = number of channels

In both cases, the first 6 (earlier) or 8 (later) bytes should be skipped.


Song headers
===================
Song headers are structured as follows:
(NOTE: The mapping of channels corresponds to the instruments.)
1 = Number of channels
2 = Number of "patterns" (-1)?
(Modify the following values below for the number of channels/patterns:)
3-4 = Channel 2 start pointer
5-6 = Channel 1 start pointer
7-8 = Channel 3 start pointer
9-10 = Channel 4 start pointer
11-12 = Channel 2 loop pointer
13-14 = Channel 1 loop pointer
15-16 = Channel 3 loop pointer
17-18 = Channel 4 loop pointer
19-20 = Channel 2 end pointer
21-22 = Channel 1 end pointer
23-24 = Channel 3 end pointer
25-26 = Channel 4 end pointer

Song commands
===================
Commands:
xx (00-23) = Set envelope
xx (24-7F) = Change note (These are the same as MIDI values)
xx (80-B0) = Play note OR rest at specified length (if not initialized, plays a rest) - the note length values are loaded from a table
B1 = Stop track
B2 xxxx = Go to loop point (infinite loop)
B3 xxxx = Call macro
B4 = End of pattern/macro
BC xx = Set tempo
BD xx = Transpose
BE xx = Set instrument (this also
BF xx (yy?) = Set channel/instrument parameters?
Cx yy = Noise effect
D0-FF? = Change note size
